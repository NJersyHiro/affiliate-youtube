## Summary of Completed Work:

### Phase 1 - Foundation (Completed ✓)
- Created comprehensive configuration system with Google GenAI/Gemini support
- Implemented error logging system that writes to development_errors.log
- Created all data models (Script, Audio, Video, Project)
- Set up utilities (logger, exceptions, error handler)

### Phase 2 - Script Modules (Completed ✓)
- ScriptGenerator: AI-powered script generation using Gemini
- ScriptProcessor: Script optimization, timing adjustment, and TTS preparation

### Current Status:
- Basic project structure is functional
- Error handling and logging are working
- Models and core script modules are ready
- Ready to proceed with Phase 3 (VoiceSynthesizer and VisualGenerator)

### Notes:
- External dependencies (PyYAML, google-generativeai, etc.) need to be installed via requirements.txt
- Import system works best when modules are imported directly rather than through package __init__ files
- All errors are being tracked in this log file as requested
