Changes Made:
- Added Gemini as primary TTS provider
- Implemented _init_gemini_tts() and _synthesize_gemini() methods
- Updated configuration to use single GOOGLE_API_KEY for both script generation and TTS
- Added 30 prebuilt Gemini voices with emotion mapping
- Updated documentation to reflect simplified setup

## Summary of Completed Work:

### Phase 1 - Foundation (Completed ✓)
- Created comprehensive configuration system with Google GenAI/Gemini support
- Implemented error logging system that writes to development_errors.log
- Created all data models (Script, Audio, Video, Project)
- Set up utilities (logger, exceptions, error handler)

### Phase 2 - Script Modules (Completed ✓)
- ScriptGenerator: AI-powered script generation using Gemini
- ScriptProcessor: Script optimization, timing adjustment, and TTS preparation

### Current Status:

- Models and core script modules are ready
- Ready to proceed with Phase 3 (VoiceSynthesizer and VisualGenerator)

### Notes:
- External dependencies (PyYAML, google-generativeai, etc.) need to be installed via requirements.txt
- Import system works best when modules are imported directly rather than through package __init__ files
- All errors are being tracked in this log file as requested
